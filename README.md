# Weather Data Analysis – May (From 14th Onwards)

## Overview
This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on hourly weather data collected during the month of May, starting from May 14. The analysis focuses on understanding temperature variations, humidity behavior, and weather condition patterns during the summer season.

The project uses data analysis and visualization techniques to extract meaningful insights from raw weather data.

---

## Objectives
The main goals of this project are:
- Analyze hourly temperature variation throughout the day
- Compare temperature differences between daytime and nighttime
- Calculate daily average temperatures
- Identify the frequency of different weather conditions
- Study humidity trends during summer

---

## Dataset Description
The dataset consists of hourly weather observations and includes:
- Date and time of observation
- Temperature in Celsius
- Relative humidity percentage
- Weather condition description

The data is stored in CSV format and represents real-world weather measurements.

---

## Data Preprocessing
Before analysis, the dataset undergoes the following steps:
- Conversion of date and time data into a usable datetime format
- Verification of missing values and duplicate entries
- Extraction of useful time-based features such as hour and day

These steps ensure data consistency and accuracy for analysis.

## Analysis Summary

### Hourly Temperature Variation
The hourly analysis reveals a clear daily temperature cycle. Temperatures are lowest during early morning hours, rise steadily after sunrise, peak in the afternoon, and decrease again during the evening.

---

### Day vs Night Temperature Comparison
A comparison between daytime and nighttime temperatures shows that daytime temperatures are consistently higher. This difference highlights the effect of solar heating during the day.

---

### Daily Average Temperature
Daily average temperatures remain relatively stable across the observed period, with minor fluctuations that are typical of summer weather patterns.

---

### Weather Condition Frequency
Certain weather conditions occur more frequently than others, indicating dominant seasonal patterns. Less frequent conditions such as rain appear occasionally.

---

### Humidity Trends
Humidity levels fluctuate from day to day. Higher humidity on certain days contributes to increased discomfort, a common characteristic of summer weather.

---

## Key Findings
- Daytime temperatures are significantly higher than nighttime temperatures
- Hourly temperature follows a predictable daily cycle
- Daily average temperatures remain consistently high
- Summer weather conditions show recurring patterns
- Humidity trends indicate moist summer conditions

---

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how exploratory data analysis can be used to study weather patterns effectively. By analyzing temperature and humidity trends, the project provides insights into summer climate behavior.

The findings from this analysis can be useful for climate studies, urban planning, agriculture, and weather forecasting.
